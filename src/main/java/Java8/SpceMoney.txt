These were asked to me in Spice money interview.


## Query to find all employees having 3rd highest salary.
select *
from employess
where salary = ( select Distinct salary
				 FROM employee
				order by salary desc
				Limit 1,2);

Convert the above query to java 8.

//find 3rd highest
thirdHighest = salariesList.stream().distinct().sort(Comparator.reverse())
	.skip(2).findfirst()

//filter only employees having 3rd highest salary
List<Employee> = employeeList.stream.filter(e->e.getSalary == thirdHighest)
			.collect(Collectors.toList())
